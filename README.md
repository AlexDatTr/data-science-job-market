Getting a job data science job has been my goal and that I've been trying to achive since early 2023, and it's time consuming to read through all the job description to know the skills you need for the job. Over the pass few months, I have been actively searching and applying for data science jobs, and I found out the the skills companies are hiring for data science roles are quite large, depending on the company tech stack and data pipeline. So the initial goal of the project is to extract the skills given job description and perform an analysis on the skill extracted.
